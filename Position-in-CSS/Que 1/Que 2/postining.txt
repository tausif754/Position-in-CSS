
Absolute Positioning:
Absolute positioning involves specifying the exact position of an element relative to a parent or containing element that has a defined position
(usually non-static, like relative, absolute, or fixed). 
Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal flow of content, and 
it is often used to overlay elements or create fixed-position elements on a webpage.
-Common CSS properties for absolute positioning include position:
- absolute; and the top, bottom, left, and right properties are used to specify the exact position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
-EXAMPLE:-
div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 100px;
}

Relative Positioning:
-Relative positioning involves specifying the position of an element relative to its default or
 natural position within its containing element. 
-It is often used in the context of web design and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for HTML elements.
Common CSS properties for relative positioning include position: relative; and using properties like top, bottom, left, and right 
to adjust the position relative to the default position.
EXAMPLE:-
div {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 30px;
}
